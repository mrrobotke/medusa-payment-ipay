## 🔧 Test Categories Implemented

### 1. Unit Tests (`src/providers/ipay/__tests__/service.test.ts`)

**Core Service Testing:**
- ✅ Constructor and initialization validation

**Test Validation Highlights:**
```
✓ should have correct identifier
✓ should initialize with correct options
✓ should validate required options successfully
✓ should throw error if vid is missing
✓ should throw error if hashKey is missing
✓ should initiate payment successfully
✓ should handle live mode correctly
✓ should handle test mode correctly
✓ should include hash in payment data
✓ should authorize payment successfully
✓ should capture payment successfully
✓ should cancel payment successfully
✓ should process refund successfully
✓ should retrieve payment data successfully
✓ should handle empty input
✓ should update payment successfully
✓ should delete payment successfully
✓ should get payment status successfully
✓ should default to pending status
✓ should handle successful payment webhook
✓ should handle pending payment webhook
✓ should generate correct hash
✓ should handle missing context gracefully
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`integration-tests/http/webhook.spec.ts`)

**Webhook API Testing:**
- ✅ POST webhook processing for all payment statuses
- ✅ GET callback handling for payment confirmations
- ✅ Error handling for malformed payloads
- ✅ Security testing (XSS, SQL injection prevention)
- ✅ Performance testing (concurrent requests, timing)
- ✅ Edge case handling (large payloads, empty data)

**iPay Status Code Coverage:**
- ✅ `aei7p7yrx4ae34` - Successful payments
- ✅ `bdi6p2yy76etrs` - Pending payments
- ✅ `fe2707etr5s4wq` - Failed payments
- ✅ `dtfi4p7yty45wq` - Less amount payments
- ✅ `cr5i3pgy9867e1` - Used code payments
- ✅ Unknown status handling

## 🛡️ Security Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive security validation:
- **XSS Prevention**: Tests script injection in webhook parameters
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Tests malicious SQL in payment data
- **Hash Validation**: Tests cryptographic hash integrity
- **Input Sanitization**: Tests various malformed input scenarios

## ⚡ Performance Testing

Performance benchmarks included:
- **Concurrent Requests**: Validates handling of simultaneous webhooks
- **Response Time**: Ensures webhooks process within 10 seconds
- **Large Payload Handling**: Tests processing of oversized requests
- **Memory Stability**: Validates consistent memory usage

## 🔒 No Hardcoded Credentials

**Security Validation:**
- ✅ No hardcoded VID or hash keys in the codebase
- ✅ Environment variables properly utilized
- ✅ Test credentials clearly marked as placeholders
- ✅ Production settings isolated from test configurations

**Search Results Confirmation:**
```bash
# Searched for potential hardcoded credentials
grep -r "8H8UEM2eKfPYAKW" src/ # ❌ Not found
grep -r "demoCHANGED" src/    # ✅ Only in documentation/placeholders
```

## 🧪 Test Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **@medusajs/test-utils**: Official Medusa testing utilities

- **Payment Context Builders**: Realistic payment scenario simulation
- **Webhook Payload Builders**: iPay-compliant test data

### Coverage Configuration
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  "src/providers/**/*.ts": {
    branches: 70,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 85,
    statements: 85,
  },
}
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Analysis
